# about servers pinger
PowerShell console script for pinging list of servers to check if they are online

# how does it work
Script checks if servers are online every 60 seconds by default. If server is offline - script:
- shows desktop notification
- plays signal
- sends Telegram message from bot (that you configured)

# how to set up and start for the first time
1. add your servers to **servers.json** pointing server OS (Windows based/Linux based) and port (22 for Linux based and 3389 for Windows based) in JSON format:
     ```
     [
       { "IP": "7.77.7.77", "Port": 3389, "Type": "Windows" },   
       { "IP": "1.2.3.4", "Port": 22, "Type": "Linux" }
     ]
     ```
3. install [nmap](https://nmap.org/download.html) Ð¸ [npcap](https://npcap.com/#download)
4. run this script in your PowerShell to install BurntToast:
     `Install-Module -Name BurntToast -Force`
5. run this script in your PowerShell to allow local scripts execution:
     `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
6. reboot you PC/server/VM
7. configure **CheckServers.ps1**:
- edit line 16 - set telegram bot **token** (You can create new bot  with Telegram bot @BotFather)
- edit line 17 - set telegram **chat_id** (You can get chat_id if you write any message to your bot and then open in browser `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates` and search for your message from before)
- edit line 32 (optional) - to change log location
- edit line 88 (optional) - to change time interval between script repeats
- save changes!

P.S. script supports **hot servers list change** - you can edit servers list and save it when script is working
